### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜€

I am an Agricultural and Environmental Engineer (UFRRJ), M.Sc in Energy Technology (IEE-USP). I have expertise in energy generation from renewable resources. My skills included: elaboration of maps using Software QGISÂ® and ArcGISÂ®, delimitation of hydrographic basins and computational modelling using Softwares such as HruWeb, ArcSWAT and JAMS.</br>
After I finished my Master, I started to look for information about Data Science and also in parallel my process to move to Germany. I started to take online courses about Data Science at Alura, a Brazilian online coding school. There I discovered a new passion, that is to analyze data and the storytelling with data, to transform complex numbers and disconnected information in valuable information fascinates me. For that reason, I decided to focus entirely on my technical aspirations by starting a bootcamp to become a full-fledged data-scientist. The training  from 24.06 to 7.10.2022.
